DNS Resolution: It all begins with your browser initiating a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup to translate the human-readable domain name (e.g., www.google.com) into an IP address, which serves as the server’s unique identifier on the internet.
Establishing a Connection: Once the browser obtains the IP address, it establishes a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). This handshake ensures a reliable and error-checked connection between your device and the server.
Security Measures — HTTPS/SSL: In the era of online security, the request is encrypted via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol, ensuring secure transmission of data. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol facilitates the encryption and decryption process, protecting your data from potential eavesdropping or tampering.
Navigating Firewalls: As the request traverses through networks, it encounters firewalls that act as guardians, scrutinizing and filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules to ensure network security.
Load Balancing: In scenarios where the website’s traffic is substantial, load balancers come into play. They distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed, thus ensuring a smoother browsing experience.
Web and Application Servers: Upon reaching the servers, the request is processed. Web servers handle static content (HTML, CSS, etc.), while application servers manage dynamic content (user-specific information, databases, etc.).
Database Interaction: For pages requiring dynamic content, the application server interacts with databases to retrieve and process relevant data. This step ensures that the content served to you is personalized and up-to-date.
